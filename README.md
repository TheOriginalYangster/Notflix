## Notes 

### Add-Ons
**React Router**
**SASS**
I work pretty heavily with both of these.  

**react-multi-carousel**
One of the interview questions I received last time I interviewed was "What advantages does React.js have over other front-end libraries?  Well, access to a vast amount of component libraries is one of them.  I used this carousel component for the landing page.

### Misc

I thought this project was very fun!  I don't normally work with Redux or Hooks API, and have never worked with Typescript or Redux Toolkit.  I was hoping to take some time on this and learn some new tools, but due to constraints I had to get this done sooner.

I created my own repository because the colors of the browser IDE were not what I am used to, and I found them overwhelming.  I hope this isn't too much of a problem for you.

I'm looking forward to hearing back from you all!

Sincerely,

-Will Yang
